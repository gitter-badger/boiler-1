boilerplate package for rapid api laravel development.

This package is under construction ^^, can't wait to make the first release.

## Boiler will provide you with...
* An abstract api controller, to automatically add the crud operations.
* Multiple traits like response trait, to respond with api response and codes.
* An abstract and default transformer to edit the response format.
* Authentification with laraval passport package.
* policy with entrust package.
* a console command to create files automatically for us.
* .... and more, just wait ;)
